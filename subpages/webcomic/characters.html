                    <p>That's him! that's the guy! Alwyn's a capable pirate, Though he doesn't like to talk about where he learned all that. Or any of his past, for that matter. It seems to weigh on him quite a bit. His friends aren't one to pry though.</p>

                    <p>She and cat have been travelling together for quite a few years now, and she's one of the few people he has ever been able to confide in. But she's got plenty issues of her own... Being the most level-headed of her friends, she has taken on a de facto position of leadership. Now if only they'd listen to her...</p>

                    <p>Unwaveringly optimistic and a beastly acrobat by blood. With no past or family to speak of, one day they started following Cat and Clementine, and they never left. They're also non-binary so if I catch any of you misgendering them your ass is toast. </p>
