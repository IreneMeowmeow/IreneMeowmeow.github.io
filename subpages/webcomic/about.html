        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This is <strong>Pirate Cat</strong>, a comic I have been working on for quite a while now! It's about Alwyn over here, and his crew. But no one really calls him that, he'd much prefer you'd just call him Cat.</p>

            <p>He'll gladly take you along on his adventures, though probably with a bit of pissing and moaning. I can't promise they'll always be <i>dramatic</i> or <i>interesting</i>. But I can certainly guarantee that they'll find a way to fuck it up, no matter how easy their tasks may be.</p> 
            <p>But then again. So far he's managed to crawl out of his little messes. So I wouldn't be too worried about him.</p>
            <p>and <strong>Thank you</strong> for lending your eyeballs to my little project!</p>
